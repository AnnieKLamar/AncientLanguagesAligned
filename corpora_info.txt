Text alignment was done manually by Annie K. Lamar.

The following changes were made to the texts used in this corpora:
-slight adjustments were made for the sake of alignment, including small translations by myself. For example, if a translator neglected to translate "ναί." I added a line "Yes."
occasionally small numbers of lines (1-5 lines) were deleted if it appeared the translator had skipped them or heavily paraphrased or summarized.
