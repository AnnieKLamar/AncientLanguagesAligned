Instructions
1. Make sure that every line of Greek/Latin matches the same line number in English.
These lines could be sentences, speakers' names, or empty lines- they just have to match perfectly.

  OKAY:
    -split in the middle of a sentence in between distinct phrases, or on semi-colons
    Example:
    Kathryn and I went to the movies, and then we went to the mall.
    -->
    Kathryn and I went to the movies,
    and then we went to the mall. (<-- even in Greek/Latin, this is a complete phrase, and no grammar is dependent on the first line)

  NOT OKAY:
    -split in the middle of a sentence such that one line does not make sense without the other.
    Example:
      Kathryn and I went to the movies and to the mall.
      -->
      Kathryn and I went to the movies
      and to the mall. (<-- In Greek/Latin, the computer has no idea why this fragment is accusative.)

2. Delete any citations. (Inputted by editor)
  Example: And then I said, "Ego volo credere." Julius Proclus. Before Times. Part 5.
           -->
           And then I said, "Ego volo credere."

3. Delete any English notes or text added to the Greek/Latin by the editor.
***This is particulary important in the Latin text***

4. Sometimes things won't align. For example, a translator paraphrased heavily or added extra sets of back-and-forth-dialogue.
You can move things onto new lines or combine two lines into one - it's fine as long as things line up.
Because of the way the sentences were split, sometimes a quote might begin on one line and end on another.
You can decide whether to combine them or let them be based on how the Greek is phrased.
It's okay to delete lines from either text in this case in order to make the texts align.
This won't happen very often- I've deleted two lines in 5,000 lines of alignment.

5. You can safely ignore:
-Quotation marks.
-empty lines (as long as both files have empty lines in the same places)
-names of speakers
-bracketed section labels (NOTE: anything in brackets will be deleted)
-double spaces or spaces at the end of sentences (any extra white space)

SOMETHING BROKE, WHAT DO I DO?
-"My Greek text looks like WingDings!"
  Edit --> Select Encoding --> UTF-16 LE

-"I hate these colors!"
  File --> Settings --> Themes

-"Something is very clearly wrong with the file. I think maybe a text is missing."
 Copy what you have aligned into a new text (.txt) file and save. Let me know.
