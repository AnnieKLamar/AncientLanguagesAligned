To them he speaks in this manner: that he is the consul; that one of his brothers has Sicily for his province; that the other is to be judge in all prosecutions for extortion; and that care had been taken in many ways that there should be no possibility of Verres being injured. ~~~ [28]
I ask you, Metellus, what is corrupting the course of justice, if this is not, to seek to frighten witnesses, and especially Sicilians, timid and oppressed men, not only by your own private influence, but by their fear of the consul, and by the power of two praetors?
What would you do for an innocent man or for a relation, when for the sake of a most guilty man, entirely unconnected with you, you depart from your duty and your dignity, and allow what he is constantly saying to appear true to any one who is not acquainted with you?
[29] For they said that Verres said, that you had not been made consul by destiny, as the rest of your family had been, but by his assistance.
Two consuls, therefore, and the judge are to be such because of his will.

We shall not only, says he, avoid having a man too scrupulous in investigating, too subservient to the opinion of the people, Marcus Glabrio, but we shall have this advantage also:
Marcus Caesonius is the judge, the colleague of our accuser a man of tried and proved experience in the decision of actions.
It will never do for us to have such a man as that on the bench, which we are endeavouring to corrupt by some means or other; for before, when he was one of the Judges on the tribunal of which Junius was president, he was not only very indignant at that shameful transaction, but he even betrayed and denounced it.

After the first of January we shall not have this man for our judge,  [30] we shall not have Quintus Manlius and Quintus Cornificius, two most severe and upright judges, for judges, because they will then be tribunes of the people.
Publius Sulpicius, a solemn and upright judge, must enter on his magistracy on the fifth of November. ~~~
Marcus Crepereius, of that renowned equestrian family and of that incorruptible character; Lucius Cassius, of a family renowned for its severity in all things, and especially as judges; Cnaeus Tremellius, a man of the greatest scrupulousness and diligence; these three men of ancient strictness of principle are all military tribunes elect. ~~~ After the first of January they will not be able to act as judges.
And besides this, we elect by lot a successor in the room of Marcus Metellus, since he is to preside over this very trial.
And so after the first of January, the praetor, and almost the whole bench of judges being changed, we shall elude the terrible threats of the prosecutor, and the great expectations entertained of this trial, and manage it according to our own will and pleasure.
[31] Today is the fifth of August. ~~~ You began to assemble at the ninth hour.
This day they do not even count. ~~~
There are ten days between this and the votive games which Cnaeus Pompeius is going to celebrate.
These games will take up fifteen days; then immediately the Roman games will follow. ~~~
And so, when nearly forty days have intervened, then at length they think they shall have to answer what has been said by us; and they think that, what with speeches, and what with excuses, they will easily be able to protract the cause till the period of the games of Victory. ~~~
With these the plebeian games are connected, after which there will be either no day at all, or very few for pleading in. ~~~ And so, when the accusation has got stale and cold, the matter will come all fresh before Marcus Metellus as praetor. ~~~ And if I had distrusted his good faith, I should not have retained him as a judge.
[32] But now I have such an opinion of him, that I would rather this matter was brought to a close while he is judge than while he is praetor; and I would rather entrust to him his own tablet while he is on his oath, than the tablets of others when he is restrained by no such obligation.
Now, O judges, I consult you as to what you think I ought to do. ~~~
For you will, in truth, without speaking, give me that advice which I understand that I must inevitably adopt.
If I occupy the time which I legitimately might in speaking, I shall reap the fruit of my labour, industry, and diligence; and by this prosecution I shall make it manifest that no one in the memory of man appears ever to have come before a court of justice better prepared, more vigilant, or with his cause better got up.
But while I am getting this credit for my industry, there is great danger lest the criminal may escape.
What, then, is there which can be done?
I think it is neither obscure nor hidden.
[33] I will reserve for another time that fruit of praise which may be derived from a long uninterrupted speech.
At present I must support this accusation by documentary evidence, by witnesses, by letters of private individuals and of public bodies, and by various other kinds of proof.
The whole of this contest is between you and me, O Hortensius.
I will speak openly.

If I thought that you were contending with me in the matter of speaking, and of getting rid of the charges I bring against your client in this cause, I, too, would devote much pains to mounting an elaborate accusation, and to dilating on my charges.
Now, since you have determined to contend against me with artifice, not so much in obedience to the promptings of your own nature, as from consulting his occasions and his cause, it is necessary for me to oppose conduct of that sort with prudence.
[34] Your plan is, to begin to answer me after two sets of games have been celebrated; mine is to have the adjournment over before the first series.
And the result will be, that that plan of yours will be thought crafty, but this determination of mine necessary.
But as for what I had begun to say, namely, that the contest is between you and me, this is it,
I, when I had undertaken this cause at the request of the Sicilians, and had thought it a very honourable and glorious thing for me that they were willing to make experiment of my integrity and diligence, who already knew by experience my innocence and temperance: then, when I had undertaken this business, I proposed to myself some greater action also by which the Roman people should be able to see my goodwill towards the republic.
[35] For that seemed to me to be by no means worthy of my industry and efforts, for that man to be brought to trial by me who had been already condemned by the judgment of all men, unless that intolerable influence of yours, and that grasping nature which you have displayed for some years in many trials, was interposed also in the case of that desperate man.
But no, since all this dominion and sovereignty of yours over the courts of justice delights you so much, and since there are some men who are neither ashamed of their licentiousness and their infamy, nor weary of it, and who, as if on purpose, seem to wish to encounter hatred and unpopularity from the Roman people,
I profess that I have undertaken this, a great burden perhaps, and one dangerous to myself, but still worthy of my applying myself to it with all the vigour of my age, and all diligence.
[36] And since the whole order of the senate is weighed down by the discredit brought on it by the wickedness and audacity of a few, and is overwhelmed by the infamy of the tribunals, I profess myself an enemy to this race of men, an accuser worthy of their hatred, a persevering, a bitter adversary.
I arrogate this to myself, I claim this for myself, and I will carry out this enmity in my magistracy, and from that post in which the Roman people has willed that from the next first of January I shall act in concert with it in matters concerning the republic, and concerning wicked men.
I promise the Roman people that this shall be the most honourable and the fairest employment of my aedileship.
I warn, I forewarn, I give notice beforehand to those men who are wont either to put money down, to undertake for others, to receive money, or to promise money, or to act as agents in bribery, or as go-betweens in corrupting the seat of judgment, and who have promised their influence or their impudence in aid of such a business, in this trial to keep their hands and inclinations from this nefarious wickedness.
[37] ~~~ Hortensius will then be consul with the chief command and authority, but I shall be aedile that is, I shall be a little more than a private individual; and yet this business, which I promise that I am going to advocate, is of such a nature, so pleasing and agreeable to the Roman people, that the consul himself will appear in this cause, if that be possible, even less than a private individual in comparison of me.
All those things shall not only be mentioned, but even, where certain matters have been explained, shall be fully discussed, which for the last ten years, ever since the office of the judge has been transferred to the senate, has been nefariously and wickedly done in the decision of judicial matters.
[38] The Roman people shall know from me why it is that when the equestrian body supplied the judges for nearly fifty years together, not even the slightest suspicion ever arose of bribes having been accepted for the purpose of influencing a decision;
why it is, I say, when the judicial authority was transferred to the senatorial body, and the power of the Roman people over every one of us was taken away, Quintus Calidius, when he was condemned, said that a man of praetorian rank could not honestly be condemned at a less price than three hundred thousand sesterces;
