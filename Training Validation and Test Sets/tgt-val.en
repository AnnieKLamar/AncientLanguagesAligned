Now if the Athenians should deliberate with whom they should wrestle close, and with whom only at arm's length, and in what manner, would you or the wrestling-master be the better adviser?
The wrestling-master, I presume.
And can you tell me what the wrestling-master would have in view when he advised as to the persons with whom they ought or ought not to wrestle close, and when and in what manner?
What I mean is something like this: ought they not to wrestle close with those with whom it is better to do so?
Yes.
And so far as is better, too?
So far.
And at such time also as is better?
Certainly.
But again, when one sings, one has sometimes to accompany the song with harping and stepping?
Yes, one has.
And at such time as is better?
Yes.
And so far as is better?
I agree.
Well now, since you applied the term �better� to the two cases of harping for accompaniment of a song and close wrestling, what do you call the �better� in the case of harping, to correspond with what in the case of wrestling I call gymnastic? What do you call the other?
I do not understand.
Well, try to copy me:
for my answer gave you, I think, what is correct in every instance; and that is correct, I presume, which proceeds by rule of the art, is it not?
Yes.
And was not the art here gymnastic?
To be sure.
And I said that the better in the case of wrestling was gymnastic.
You did.
And I was quite fair?
I think so.
Come then, in your turn�for it would befit you also, I fancy, to argue fairly�tell me, first, what is the art which includes harping and singing and treading the measure correctly?
What is it called as a whole?
You cannot yet tell me?
No, indeed.
Well, try another way: who are the goddesses that foster the art?
The Muses, you mean, Socrates?
I do.
Now, just think, and say by what name the art is called after them.
Music, I suppose you mean.
Yes, I do.
And what is that which proceeds correctly by its rule?
As in the other case I was correct in mentioning to you gymnastic as that which goes by the art, so I ask you, accordingly, what you say in this case.
What manner of proceeding is required?
A musical one, I suppose.
You are right.
Come then, what is it that you term �better,� in respect of what is better in waging war and being at peace?
Just as in our other instances you said that the �better� implied the more musical and again, in the parallel case, the more gymnastical, try now if you can tell me what is the �better� in this case.
But I am quite unable.
But surely that is disgraceful; for if you should speak to somebody as his adviser on food, and say that one sort was better than another, at this time and in this quantity,
and he then asked you�What do you mean by the �better,� Alcibiades?�in a matter like that you could tell him you meant the more wholesome, although you do not set up to be a physician;
yet in a case where you set up to have knowledge and are ready to stand up and advise as though you knew, are you not ashamed to be unable, as appears, to answer a question upon it?
Does it not seem disgraceful?
Very.
Then consider and do your best to tell me the connection of �better� in being at peace or at war with those to whom we ought to be so disposed.
